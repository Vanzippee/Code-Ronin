		<h1> Liquid Layout:<small><small> the new net reality</small></small></h1><br>
		<p> Where are you reading this? <br><br>
		Probably more to the point; what are you reading this on?<br><br>
		I have no idea how you are planning to consume the information on this page, there are just too many options. The one screen that I developed this on is not the one you are going to view it on, and if this page can't conform to your needs, then you probably just won't use it.</p>
		<p>This is the reality today with as many users accessing content on mobile devices as they do on their home computers. Even home computers have a variety of resolutions, not to mention what hapens when the window isn't maximised!</p>
		<p>There is no possible way to taylor a page to evey device, and there is no need to. Liquid layouts act like a liquid filling the container they are put into - more appropriatly onto in this case. This lets content move from the small screen of a tablet or netbook, to a large TV at the center of an entertainment unit and still be functional.</p>
		<p>This level of liquidity is not an option or a luxury anymore, this is a necessity. The amount of content on the web is tremendous, and the sites that get used are the ones that allow users to access it most efficiently. This means where they want, when they want, and on the device they want it on. If if looks good on thier laptop, but crappy on their i-phone, then they will probably look for a new place to go.</p>
